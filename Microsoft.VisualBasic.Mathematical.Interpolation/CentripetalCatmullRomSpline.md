###### Centripetal Catmull–Rom spline
 
 In computer graphics, centripetal Catmull–Rom spline is a variant form of 
 Catmull-Rom spline formulated by Edwin Catmull and Raphael Rom according 
 to the work of Barry and Goldman. It is a type of interpolating spline 
 (a curve that goes through its control points) defined by four control points
 P0, P1, P2, P3, with the curve drawn only from P1 to P2.

|Parameter Name|Remarks|
|--------------|-------|
|pa|four control points P0, P1, P2, P3, with the curve drawn only from P1 to P2.|
|alpha!|set from 0-1|

>  #### How do I convert an IP address to an IP number?
>  
>  IP address (IPV4) is divided into four sub-blocks. Each sub-block has a different weight number, 
>  each powered by 256. The IP number is being used in the database because it is efficient to search 
>  between a range of numbers in the database.
>  
>  The beginning IP number and the ending IP number are calculated based on the following formula:
>  
>  ```
>  IP Number = 16777216*w + 65536*x + 256*y + z (1)
>  ```
>  
>  where:
>  
>  ```
>  IP Address = w.x.y.z
>  ```
>  
>  For example, if the IP address is ``202.186.13.4``, then its IP number is ``3401190660`` based on the above formula.
>  
>  ```
>  IP Address = 202.186.13.4
>  ```
>  
>  So, ``w = 202, x = 186, y = 13`` and ``z = 4``
>  
>  ```
>  IP Number = 16777216*202 + 65536*186 + 256*13 + 4
>            = 3388997632 + 12189696 + 3328 + 4
>            = 3401190660
>  ```
>  
>  To reverse the IP number to the IP address:
>  
>  ```
>  w = int ( IP Number / 16777216 ) % 256
>  x = int ( IP Number / 65536 ) % 256
>  y = int ( IP Number / 256 ) % 256
>  z = int ( IP Number ) % 256
>  ```
>  
>  where, ``%`` is the mod operator and int returns the integer part of the division.

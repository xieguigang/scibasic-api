>  list of 2n numbers, the Haar wavelet transform may be considered to simply pair up input values, 
>  storing the difference and passing the sum. This process is repeated recursively, pairing up the sums 
>  to provide the next scale: finally resulting in 2n-1 differences and one final sum.

>  We can identify large changes in the differences portion d of the transform.
>  It is easier to quantize the data in this form.
>  The transform concentrates the information (energy) in the signal in fewer values.
>  And the obvious answer: fewer digits!!
>  In case of images, we need 2D FWT. First, we perform 1D FWT for all rows, and next, for all columns. 
>  For color Images, we deal with RGB components of color, and perform Haar Transform for each component 
>  separately. Any component (R G B) has values from 0 to 255 to before transformation we scale this 
>  values. For displaying image after transformation, we scale back transformed values.

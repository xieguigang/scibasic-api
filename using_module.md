The ``Module`` type plays a most important role in the functional programming in visualbasic language. The VisualBasic language have a history of using the ``Module`` type since its very old time. A ``Module`` in visualbasic is a kind of alias name of ``Class`` type. ``Module`` type in visualbasic can be almost equivalent to an abstract ``Class``, but much convenient than using ``Class`` type, for example:

```vbnet
' Module in visualbasic
Public Module ExportAPI

    Public Function ComputationAPI1(x&) As Long
    End Function
End Module
```

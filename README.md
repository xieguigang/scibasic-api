### About this book
The series of articles in this book is designed to adjust your way of thinking to functional thinking, so that you can think about common problems in a new perspective and improve your daily coding work. This series describes the concept of functional programming, the framework of functional programming running in the ``VisualBasic`` language, functional programming languages running on the ``CLR``, and some directions for the future of language design. This series is primarily geared towards understanding the way ``VisualBasic`` and its abstract tiers work, but developers who lack experience in functional language use.

> In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. It is a declarative programming paradigm, which means programming is done with expressions or declarations instead of statements.[[^1]]

## Powerful feature

These language feature makes a powerful supports for the functional programming in VisualBasic language, and here I want to talking about the FP style in VisualBasic from these language features:

1. ``Module``
2. ``Extension Method``
3. ``Lambda Expression``
4. ``Generic``
5. ``Operator Overrides``
6. ``Linq & Parallel``
